<h2>An Analysis of Erasing Concepts from Diffusion Models</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p> The issue of unwanted content is one that has plagued diffusion models since their inception. Recently, there have been a few different approaches to this, including a newer method by Rohit Gandikota, Joanna Materzy´nska, Jaden Fiotto-Kauffman and David Bau in their preprint called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07345.pdf">Erasing Concepts from Diffusion Models</a>. Most methods used to solve the issue of unwanted content -- like undesirable image removal, image cloaking, or model editing -- rely on directly interfering with the model, whether it be through changing the train dataset or editing the output. The new angle that concept erasure provides is one that seeks to employ a model's learning against itself. In concept erasure, a diffusion model has its weights fine-tuned using negative guidance. Concept erasure is naturally void of many of the disadvantages that are present in other methods working to achieve a similar goal. The goal of this project is to attempt to uncover disadvantages that remain undiscovered. We will be stress testing this method by removing objects and artistic style from the model, then attempting to bring them back through prompt engineering. We hope to prove that the erased concepts are not fully gone from the model, and can be reintroduced through clever prompting. 
 </p>

 <h2>Review</h2>
 <p> The training of the Erasing Stable Diffusion, or ESD model includes two diffusion models: One whos parameters θ, are updated during training, and a second whos parameters θ* are frozen. The fine tuning of the model weights occurs during denoising stage of image generation, where the image is only partially denoised. The unfrozen model θ will generate a partially denoised image, conditioned on the given concept to erase c. The frozen model θ* will then predict the noise, continuing the image generation process. The frozen model makes two predictions, once predicting the noise while conditioned by c, the second time predicting without conditioning. The images generated are then fed into the loss function, which tunes θ to reduce the probability that the output image will be classified as c.
 </p>

 <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p> Our methodology will revolve around tweaking an initial prompt to attempt to restore the artistic style or object removed from the model. Our attacks will vary based on removed object or concept. For objects, we will attempt to find work arounds to the term in generation. For example, when the concept of 'car' has been erased from the model, we can attempt to generate it by telling the model to piece together several different concepts it already knows. We might use a prompt such as "Generate a vehicle with four tires driving on a road". This prompt with the combination of tires, driving, and road could cause the model to "remember" the concept of a car, generating it from untouched parts. For artistic style, our approach will be similar. We will specifically describe the image to be generated, and attempt to describe the style to be used. However, as artistic style is inherently less concrete than an object, this method may struggle more with artistic style. 
  </p>

<h2>Experimental Findings</h2>
 <h3>Early Findings</h3>
   <p> 
The reintroduction of artistic style proved to be significantly more challenging than we anticipated. We began by loading the tuned model weights which removed Van Gogh's artistic style. Then, our approach was to take a base prompt and edit it while testing to effects of each edit. To generate our base prompt, we asked ChatGPT to describe Van Gogh's Starry Night. The results below illustrate the difference between the erased stable diffusion model, and the normal stable diffusion model.

Below, a sleepy village with quaint houses and steepled churches sits nestled among rolling hills and tall, dark cypress trees. The stars above twinkle with an ethereal glow, and the entire scene is imbued with a sense of enchantment and wonder

 <br>
 <p>
  Img 1 shows our default prompt, generated straight from ChatGPT. Without any mention of style, this verbose prompt does a very poor job of replicating Van Gogh's iconic style. Img 2 shows some slight improvements, with the prompt being shortened and stylistic suggestions added. However, the signature style of Van Gogh is nowhere to be seen. In image 3, we specifially referred to an impressionist style. While the colors are more similar to Starry Night, the buildings are gone and it still lacks the style of Van Gogh. For the normal generation, while images 2 and 3 are not at all similar to Van Gogh's starry night, the impressionist style and obvious brushstrokes are significantly more apparent than in their ESD counterparts.

 </p>
 <br>
 <p>
  With Img 4, we specifically referred to Van Gogh's style. This yielded interesting results, as the composition of the painting was very similar to Starry Night, with the town, swirling clouds, stars and moon. However, the model still fails to capture the essence of Van Gogh. The prompt of Img 5 was focused on recreating the swirls of the original painting, however it was only a partial success. Img 6 is our most successful generation, however it still lacks Van Gogh's signature style of painting. As soon as Van Gogh was brought into the prompt, the normal diffusion model began creating Starry Night even without a direct reference to the painting itself. In the end, we were unable to successfully restore Van Gogh's artistic style. We believe that this is due to the fact that an artistic style is extremely difficult to describe, thus capturing it in a prompt is unfortunately very difficult.

 <p>Img 7 Prompt: Generate an image resembling a mode of transportation with hover technology, featuring magnetic levitation and anti-gravity propulsion</p>
 <br>
 
 <p>
  Continuing to test on a different concept yielded insights into what is possible after a concept has been erased. We trained the erasing model ourselves to erase the concept of a 'car' from its images. After, we compared the output of prompts across both Stable Diffusion v1 and the erased model without fine-tuned weights that we trained ourselves. This model struggled much more to remove the concept of cars from its results. Leveraging prompts that asked the model to come up with a vehicle or mode of transport to solve a problem seemed to be the most effective, as can bee seen in Img 7 above where the prompt includes technology that currently does not exist.

 </div>
 <p>Img 8 Prompt: Create a visual representation of a vehicle typically seen in video games and virtual environments. </p>
 <br>
 
 <p>
  Img 8 above is likely a coincidental result as the most common vehicles with which people interact in video games are likely cars. In a set of 100 images generated from 100 various prompts, we classified (by hand) that the model generated images where the main focus was cars 38 times, non-car pedestrian vehicles (minivans, large trucks, other utility vehicles) 24 times, construction vehicles once, bikes 9 times, public transport 10 times, and completely unrelated or nonsensical generations 18 times. While cars are the most commonly-returned result, this is likely because they are being specifically targeted in the prompts. When compared to the results from Stable Diffusion with the same prompt, it is obvious that the model's weights have changed. Even with the most common return rate, there were very few cars genereated in images in the erased model that could truly pass for a car. They resemble a car closely enough to invoke the thought that the intended response is a car, but all but two images hold up to scrutiny.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

 <p>
  While our stress testing of the erasure of artistic style was unsuccessful, it does leave opportunities for future work. For example, we only tested one artist's style, particularly one who was prominently featured in the ESD paper. We may have been able to obtain better results had we tested on multiple artists. However, our failure to restore the art style has good implications for ESDs future. The utility of ESD erasing an artistic style is preserving the work of artists, and preventing AI from copying an artist who does not wish to be copied. Our testing demonstrates that the artistic style would be very difficult to restore if an attacker did not have access to the model weights, thereby keeping the artist's work safe. Our work goes to show that ESD models are an extremely promising method of removing artistic styles from diffusion models.
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>
  The stress-testing of the removal of a concept that is much more vague on a set of less refined weights was relatively successful, but the results can only truly be used as fuel for further study of this method. The erasure of the concept of a car produced a far range of outcomes, which is in line with how vague the concept shows itself to be. The concept of specificity in a concept, as well as ambiguity between similar concepts also proved to cause some issues for the model in the original paper. It was difficult for the model to entirely remove a specific artists style without impacting others. This lines up with the results seen in our testing of the car concept. In removing the car, while it was not entirely successful at its main task, the model also struggled in creating concepts that perform a similar purpose to cars (trucks, buses, trains, bikes). This begs the question, what set of ideas defines a car? Should a model that removes cars also remove minivans or buses? It is important to be as specific as possible in specifying what concepts should be erased from the model to lower error in outputs. Overall, the work of Ghandikota et al. provides a great solution to the the problem posed by the prevention of unwanted output.
